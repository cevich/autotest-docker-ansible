# List of peon attribute name(s) to compute matrix product.
# Each referenced attribute in each peon (above or in defaults) must
# contain a list of dictionaries.  Each dictionary must define values
# for the keys: 'key' and 'value'. Where key's value represents the
# peon attribute to modify, and value is the data to set.  The cartesian
# product (every possible combination) defines the set of peons to create.
